While trying to think of a way to attack the beast
you feel that the armor is kind of light,
even so light that you feel being lifted up a little.
Turns out the armor has a magic power,
you try to think of a solution on the spot,
but the beast gets a hit on you.
Incidentally, the beast lets out a cry.
The armor has an ability to deflect the hits.
You let the beast to kill itself by trying to
kill you.
Congratulations!
