It seems like you can win this fight,
the beast is definitely out of breath,
and your armor seems quite sturdy.
But then, out of nowhere, the beast takes out a club
and you are in such an awe that you pause
for a little, meanwhile the beast is already
swinging towards you. Well, better luck next time.
You died.
