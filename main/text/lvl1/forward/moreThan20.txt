The armor is light, the weapon is heavy.
The beast has no idea what is coming for him.
You take couple of swings and the hands of the beast are gone,
it tries to bite you, but the armor breaks it's teeth.
It seems that you have won that fight, it wasn't too hard,
you think to yourself.
Congratulations!
